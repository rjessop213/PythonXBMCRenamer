A simple script to tidy up my media folder for XBMC scraping. Requires Python 2.7+. Optionally needs an API key from thetvdb.com to get program information.

theTVDB.com integration needs an API key in order to work. Instructions on obtaining one can be found here: http://thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Programmers_API
Write the key into a file called thetvdb.com in the project directory. It'll be ignored by Git.

Please contribute information and artwork to thetvdb.com if you can.
